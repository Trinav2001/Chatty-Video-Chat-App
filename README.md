<h2>Hi, I am Trinav Rattan</h2>
<p><em>This is a personal project I built to explore WebRTC-based video calling and chat web applications using Django and JavaScript.</em></p>

The Challenge
------------

Build a functional video conferencing and chat web app similar to modern video meeting platforms, with room-based video calls and real-time messaging.

The goal was to create a fully working prototype where multiple participants can connect in a room for a video conversation with integrated chat functionality.

What I Accomplished
-------------------

I successfully implemented a real-time video calling feature supporting multiple participants in a room. I also implemented:

1. Login/SignUp
2. Ability to update profile, reset password, and recover forgotten password
3. Join different rooms
4. Create your own room
5. Chat functionality within rooms
6. Messages saved to the database
7. Video call with participants in a room
8. Toggle audio on/off
9. Toggle video on/off
10. Chatbox during video calls
11. Fully responsive site design for desktop and mobile

Note: In-room chat does not persist after the meeting ends; chat messages reset when participants leave the room.

Technologies Used 
-----------------

1. Django
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Bootstrap
5. JavaScript
6. WebRTC

What I Learned
--------------

During this project, I gained practical experience in integrating WebRTC for real-time video communication in a web app, connecting frontend and backend components seamlessly.

I also learned to:
- Build scalable room-based video chat systems
- Handle frontend video/audio stream toggling
- Manage user authentication and profile management with Django
- Design responsive UIs for better user experience

Through multiple iterations, I improved my understanding of building full-stack applications with real-time features.

Future Possible Functionalities
-------------------------------

1. Add notification feature
2. Improve UI/UX with advanced animations
3. Add dark mode
4. Add pagination to chat history
5. Reduce video/audio latency
6. Increase scalability for larger meetings
7. Integrate screen sharing functionality
